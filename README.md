This assignment was fun! I had some issues with the grid for my cards, particularly with mobile trying to get them to look as I wanted. On tablet, it looks like I want (two items per row), but not on the phone sizes on my browser; not sure how to combat that. The components I employed were the cards and the modal pop-out of Chewie.
